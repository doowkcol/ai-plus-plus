# AI++ – AI-Native Programming Language
Concept by Jack Lockwood (@Doowkcol), 2025.

## Overview
AI++ is a programming language engineered for AI systems rather than humans, purpose-built to minimize computational overhead in code generation. By design, it achieves 3–4× token efficiency and up to 70% lower inference compute compared to traditional languages like Python or C#.

It features native vector operations, probabilistic constructs, effect-safe GPU integration, and a strictly regular syntax optimized for machine authorship. Typical AI++ programs express in 300 lines what Python needs 1,200–1,500, drastically reducing token count, latency, and energy per generation.

AI++ targets multi-agent and autonomous development systems, enabling concise, verifiable, and cooperative programming between AIs with predictable structure and minimal hallucination risk.

## Features
- **Syntax**: Vector literals (`<0.1,0.1,0.1>`), probabilistic ops (`~0.01`), parallel blocks.
- **Efficiency**: ~25 tokens vs. Python’s ~90 for equivalent tasks (e.g., neural optimizer).
- **Goals**: Enable agent swarms for dynamic tasks (e.g., adaptive game logic), reduce data center inference costs by 10-20%.
- **Current State**: Python interpreter prototype. Needs C++/LLVM for standalone compilation.

## Demo (Neural Optimizer)
```aipp
// AI++ by Jack Lockwood (@Doowkcol), 2025
f optimize_weights(w<0.1,0.1,0.1>, target_loss~0.01, epochs) {
  loss=1.0; i=0;
  w_gpu=to_gpu(w);
  while(i<epochs & loss>target_loss) {
    grad=<0.01,0.02,0.01>;
    w_gpu=optimize(w_gpu-grad);
    loss=similarity(w_gpu,<0.5,0.5,0.5>);
    conf=~0.8;
    out("Epoch",i,": Loss=",loss,"Conf=",conf);
    if(conf>0.95) { break; }
    i=i+1;
  }
  return to_cpu(w_gpu);
}
weights=<0.1,0.1,0.1>;
result=optimize_weights(weights, ~0.01, 10);
out("Optimized weights:", result);
