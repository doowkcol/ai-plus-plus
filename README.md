# AI++ – AI-Native Programming Language
Concept by Jack Lockwood (@Doowkcol), 2025.

## Overview
AI++ is a programming language designed for AI systems, not humans. It prioritizes token efficiency, native vector operations, probabilistic constructs, and GPU integration to reduce compute and hallucination in AI-generated code. Current AI coding (Python, C#) is verbose, requiring 1500 lines for tasks AI++ handles in 300. Target: multi-agent systems with concise, safe collaboration.

## Features
- **Syntax**: Vector literals (`<0.1,0.1,0.1>`), probabilistic ops (`~0.01`), parallel blocks.
- **Efficiency**: ~25 tokens vs. Python’s ~90 for equivalent tasks (e.g., neural optimizer).
- **Goals**: Enable agent swarms for dynamic tasks (e.g., adaptive game logic), reduce data center inference costs by 10-20%.
- **Current State**: Python interpreter prototype. Needs C++/LLVM for standalone compilation.

## Demo (Neural Optimizer)
```aipp
// AI++ by Jack Lockwood (@Doowkcol), 2025
f optimize_weights(w<0.1,0.1,0.1>, target_loss~0.01, epochs) {
  loss=1.0; i=0;
  w_gpu=to_gpu(w);
  while(i<epochs & loss>target_loss) {
    grad=<0.01,0.02,0.01>;
    w_gpu=optimize(w_gpu-grad);
    loss=similarity(w_gpu,<0.5,0.5,0.5>);
    conf=~0.8;
    out("Epoch",i,": Loss=",loss,"Conf=",conf);
    if(conf>0.95) { break; }
    i=i+1;
  }
  return to_cpu(w_gpu);
}
weights=<0.1,0.1,0.1>;
result=optimize_weights(weights, ~0.01, 10);
out("Optimized weights:", result);
